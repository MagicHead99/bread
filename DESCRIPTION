Description: 'b stands for 'big files'. A simple wrapper for data.table::fread() that allows subsetting or
    filtering rows and selecting columns of csv files too large for the available RAM.
    The package is using unix commands like grep, cut and sed through (hopefully)
    intuitive parameters. IMPORTANT: On Windows environments, you need to have those Unix commands
    available and finable in your "PATH". The easiest way is to install "RTools". Alternatively,
    MinGW, Git or Cygwin should also work if the /bin/ folders are in your Path.
