Title: Analyze Big Files Without Loading Them in Memory
Version: 0.2.2

Description: A simple set of wrapper functions for data.table::fread() that allows subsetting or
    filtering rows and selecting columns of table-formatted files too large for the available RAM.
    'b stands for 'big files'. The package is using Unix commands like grep, cut and sed 
    through (hopefully) intuitive parameters.
    bread makes heavy use of Unix commands like grep, sed, wc, awk and cut. They are available 
    by default in all Unix environments.
    For Windows, you need to install those commands externally in order to simulate a 
    Unix environment and make sure that the executables are in the Windows PATH variable.
    To my knowledge, the simplest ways are to install RTools, Git or Cygwin. If they have been 
    correctly installed (with the expected registry entries), they should be detected on loading
    the package and the correct directories will be added automatically to the PATH.
