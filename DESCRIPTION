Package: bread
Title: Analyze Big Files Without Loading Them in Memory
Version: 0.1.4
Authors@R: 
    person("Vincent", "Guegan", , "vincent.guegan@banque-france.fr", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A simple set of wrapper functions for data.table::fread() that allows subsetting or
    filtering rows and selecting columns of table-formatted files too large for the available RAM.
    'b stands for 'big files'. The package is using Unix commands like grep, cut and sed 
    through (hopefully) intuitive parameters.
    IMPORTANT: On Windows environments, you need to have those Unix commands
    available in your "PATH". The easiest way is to install "RTools". Alternatively,
    Git or Cygwin should also work if their /bin/ folders are in your Path.
